# live-markdown-previewer
This is my submission to freeCodeCamp's project of creating a live markdown previewer. This web-app was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/#/README.md#README.md). The markdown is stylized in GitHub flavor with the help of a [stylesheet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).

If you need help understanind GitHub markdown syntax, here is a [helpful link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
